And rightly so, it does enable us to do really cool things, things we couldn‚Äôt even imagine doing just a decade ago. In fact, it sometimes just feels like magic. This ‚Äòmagic‚Äô behind it is often powered by ‚ÄúMachine Learning‚Äù. But even ‚ÄúAI‚Äù has its limitations.

This article will showcase you that you can analyse data from the internet movie database(IMDb) for this, using Star Trek The Next Generation as example series.

Yes! Great, I also thought I knew, as did a colleague of mine. The problem: each of us had a different interpretation of the meaning.
